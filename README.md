PDF Merger App lets you merge two PDF files into one. Select pages, swap files, and create a new merged PDF.

A page range is a way to specify which pages of a PDF you want to include in the merged document. It can be defined in several formats:
All Pages: Leave the field empty.
Specific Page: To include a single specific page, you can specify its number, e.g., 5 for page 5.
Range of Pages: To include a range of pages, you can use a hyphen to separate the start and end pages, e.g., 3-7 for pages 3 through 7.
